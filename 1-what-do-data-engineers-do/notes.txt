Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; 
where would you start? 
How would you go about gathering requirements? 


1. Understanding Business Objective

I need to undertand what are the key business goals,
what decisions stakeholders need to make.
Understanding the business goals will help me to gather relevant data. 

2. Understanding the Data

I need to communicate with the stakeholders to know what data stakeholders needs.
It can be known by understanding their day-to-day decisions and activities that used.

3. Define The Reporting needs

I need to define what information they want to get from the data by seeing dashboard reporting.
It can be frequency, location, total, etc.

4. Into technical

After I already know the requirements, I start into technical stuff of Data Engineer.
It start to get data from the sources, doing ETL, store into data warehouse, until deliver data into information by making visualization dashboard.

5. Always involves the stakeholders

I will validate by confirming the data sources used by stakeholders and the dashboards they require, 
to I am on the right track.
